# Fall 2018 - ECE 478/578 - Robotics 1

Intelligent Robotics Lab Intelligent Robotics 1 Course Project

Portland State University

# Peoject Name: Turtlebot2 Einstein :

1. Robot must be able to move forward, backward, left, right, and turn around.

2. Robot must have some simple body gestures like greeting, hello, goodbye, shake hand, etc.

3. Robot must have speech capabilities: word or sentence recognition and text to speech.

4. Robot must have some vision capabilities: recognize human face (not who this person is, only that human is present and where) , recognize object (like big red box or yellow round object etc), or recognize another robot (which one).

5. Robot must use some type of Machine Learning, Evolutionary algorithm, neural net or fuzzy logic. Take it from previous projects and integrate.

# Project 2 requirements:

1.Implement speech recognition into the robot by using Google Dialogflow.

2. Implement speech synthesis into your robot by using Amazon Polly


# Project Status 1 and 2:

Completed.

# Project Goals:

1. Get the robot base to move as mentioned above with ROS implementation. (done)
2. Integrate the Camera by using OpenCV with the upper body to perform a gesture when recognizing a face. (done)
3. Get the robot to interact in an act play with two other robots. (done)
4. Be able to speak to the robot and it will respond back. (done)
